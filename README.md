This repo holds some of the sources for the Screen Orientation API, an interface
for Web applications to be able to:

  * read the screen-orientation state of a device (portrait or landscape)

  * be informed when the screen-orientation state changes

  * lock the screen orientation to a specific state

The latest editorâ€™s draft is at https://w3c.github.io/screen-orientation/Overview.html
